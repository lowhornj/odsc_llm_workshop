Today, we're diving into an intriguing exploration in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). Our focus will be on two of the most talked-about language models in recent times: BERT and GPT. However, we're not just exploring these models separately; we're setting up a friendly competition! 🏆\n","\n","In this notebook, we'll compare BERT and GPT in a classification task, offering insights into their strengths and nuances. So, grab a cup of your favorite beverage, and let's unravel the capabilities of these AI titans together!#\n","\n","### In this notebook, we will:\n","\n","    - Finetune Transformer based models for summarisation task\n","    - Prompt Engineer GPT models\n","    - Live results comparision\n","    - Performance evaluation w/ different metrics"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"53bed0aa-711c-4be2-87a5-5a8a2b43c552","metadata":{"id":"53bed0aa-711c-4be2-87a5-5a8a2b43c552"},"source":["## Setting the Stage for Our Models 🛠️\n","\n","Before we jump into the ring with BERT and GPT, let's set the stage properly. In this cell, we'll be importing all the necessary libraries and tools that we need for our analysis. Think of it as gathering all the ingredients before we start cooking our delicious NLP meal. We'll be importing pandas for data manipulation, torch for working with deep learning models, and a few other essentials. Let's get our toolbox ready!\n","\n","\n","##### We will be using a labeled dataset for summarisation.
